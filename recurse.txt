what are we doing when estblishing a sequence
    while the sequence contains less than the
    the total number of process

    for every process
        for every resource type
            if the need of this process is less
            than what we have available
                && the process is not already in the sequence list (marked)
                    add the process to the list
                    add the resources it had allocated to the available list
            else
                check the next process

base case:
if the size of available == size of system resources
