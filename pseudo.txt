Read file
    import resources
    make File from target file path
    print output to confirm reading

Use first line to determine # of processes and resource types
    Read file
    save first value as N (num processes)
    save second value as M (num resource types)

Use second line to determine # of units of each system resource
    for i < M (num resource types)
    add values to array which represents total respective resource

Use N as the "length" of the allocation matrix (next # set)
Use M as the "width" of the allocation matrix
    for i < N
        for j < M
            add values to allocation matrix

Use N as the "length" of the allocation matrix (next # set)
Use M as the "width" of the allocation matrix
    for i < N
        for j < M
            add values to max/claim matrix

Calculate need matrix
    subtract allocation values from claim values
